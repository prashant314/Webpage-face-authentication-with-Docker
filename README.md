# Webpage-face-authentication-with-Docker
Face Authentication on website using Docker and Machine Learning.

The project presents a simple way to incorporate an extra layer of authentication on a website i.e face authentication using webcam. The registration of the facial data of the user has been done and I have currently incorporated the authentication of a pre-registered user. The project is just the first step to this use case and can be extended and improved further..

## Pre-requisites
